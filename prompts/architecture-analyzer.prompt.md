Analyze the structure, main components, and relationships in this software project. Create a detailed `docs/architecture.md` file in Markdown that explains the project’s architecture. The document should include the following sections:
	1.	Overview: A brief summary of the software architecture and its main goals.
	2.	Main Components: A list and description of the primary system components (e.g., user interface, business logic, data access, database, middleware/services, infrastructure), including their responsibilities and interactions.
	3.	Component Relationships: Explain how components interact (data flow, control flow, APIs, communications), referencing architectural patterns if applicable.
	4.	Mermaid Diagrams: For each major section, include a valid Mermaid diagram (such as flowcharts or component diagrams) that visualizes the relationships and structure. Ensure all Mermaid code blocks begin with ```mermaid and follow correct syntax for rendering.
	5.	File Structure & Data Flow (Optional): If possible, include diagrams depicting file/folder structure and main data flows for context.
	6.	Instructions: Do not include implementation details; keep the documentation focused on architecture. All diagrams should be rendered with Mermaid to enable easy visualization.
Finish your output with only the contents of the generated `docs/architecture.md` file, formatted in Markdown, with all Mermaid code blocks included and correctly tagged for rendering.
